"""Typed configuration schema for a PDAP run (Hydra structured configs).

Four sections compose into :class:`ExperimentConfig`:

  * ``model``    — a registered model: structure + insertion rule + hyperparameters.
  * ``training`` — how the model is fit: outer PDAP loop + SSN solver + insertion
    numeric constants.
  * ``data``     — the data source (a key-based ``.npy``/``.npz`` path with
    arrays ``x``, ``v``, and ``dv``).
  * ``env``      — runtime: seed + logging.

Every default equals the value currently in force for the VDP signed-profile
baseline and the hardcoded library literals, so the default
``ExperimentConfig`` reproduces today's behavior.

The config is **domain-agnostic** — it describes the PDAP model and how it is
trained, not any specific control problem. The only problem-specific input is
``data.path``.
